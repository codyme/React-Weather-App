# SPA
A simple React single page application.

I developed this app during my React-Redux course with ZeoLearn.
openweathermap.org API is used to display temprature of the cities that users search for.


HOW TO SET UP YOUR ENVIRONMENT TO SEE THE APP IN ACTION:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run: npm install
3. Go to openweathermap.org and sign up to get your own API key.
4. Create a file in app/api/keys.jsx and store your key there as below:

      const mykey = 'yourkey';
      
      module.exports = mykey;
      
3. Run: node server.js
4. In your browser type: localhost:3000


This is only an sample code and is not supposed to be used in production environments, or any commercial/non-commercial projects.
